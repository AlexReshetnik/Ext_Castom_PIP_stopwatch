# Ext_Castom_PIP_stopwatch
 
During the development of projects, it was often necessary to copy and peek at parts of the code from past projects, so
I saved everything on the PC, and in git everything was in one repository (AllProjectForStyding), now
I sorted everything and created a separate repository

This is an extension for chome

Problems appeared: when closing the extension, crypt stops and pip closes

At the moment the proct is not working properly
